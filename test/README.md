### Introduction

On New Year’s Eve 2018, the White Earth Nation of [Ojibwe](https://pluralism.org/anishinaabe-ojibwe-ways) formally recognized the legal rights of manoomin, also known as [wild rice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_rice) (_Zizania palustris_). This declaration in tribal law included manoomin’s right to exist, flourish, regenerate, and evolve. The recognition of wild rice legal rights in tribal court is one of many cases in a global movement aimed at recognizing the legal rights of species and ecosystems. It is believed to be the first case in the United States brought before a tribal court on behalf of the [rights of nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights_of_nature) and attempts to establish legal rights for species and ecosystems. The case reflects an assertion of the close relationship between plant, people, and landscape predicated on an understanding of kinship and mutual reliance according to Indigenous worldview.[^1]
