### Introduction

Known for its distinct flavor and chewy texture, wild rice has become a recognizable gourmet delicacy and health food staple. Today, many Americans encounter the plant in grocery stores sold by companies such as Ben’s Original. Wild rice, or *Zizania palustris*, is an aquatic grass species native to the Great Lakes region of North America. Evidence of human use dates to the Late Archaic and [Early Woodland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodland_period) periods, around two thousand years ago.[^1] The Ojibwe are one of three tribes constituting the [Anishinaabe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anishinaabe), or "original people," an Indigenous nation in the Great Lakes region of North America. For the Ojibwe, wild rice is not only a foodstuff and a medicinal plant whose use dates back thousands of years; it is also considered a sacred being with cultural and spiritual significance. Dependent on highly specific landscape conditions for growth, the history of wild rice draws upon botanical and [Traditional Ecological Knowledge](https://blog.ucs.org/science-blogger/the-importance-of-traditional-ecological-knowledge-tek-when-examining-climate-change/) (TEK) and reflects a close interweaving between people, place, and plant.

Since the 1950s, attempts at cultivating wild rice spread from Minnesota to California. Wild rice has transformed from a rare delicacy to a commonly found staple in the advent of commercialized production and institutionalized breeding programs. Indeed, the grain boasts many health benefits, including being low in fat and high in dietary fiber, minerals, protein, and vitamins. Demand for the highly nutritious monoecious crop has prompted tensions between Indigenous growers and large-scale commercialization and commodification of the plant. Despite being a food source for humans for thousands of years, the significance of wild rice has only recently become more widely studied and understood by a broader audience, including the scientific community and general public. Issues surrounding food sovereignty, climate change-induced habitat loss, and other environmental threats, have paved the way for groundbreaking legal developments, providing environmental protections based on the recognition of wild rice as a non-human person according to Indigenous worldviews.

### Botanical Nomenclature

Northern Wild Rice, or *Zizania palustris*, is one of four wild rice species native to North America. The *Zizania* genus is housed in the Oryzeae tribe of the Poaceae (grass) family and is comprised of four species, including *Z. palustris*, *Z. aquatica*, *Z. texana*, and *Z. latifolia*. *Z. palustris* is unrelated to the more commonly known Oryza white rice domesticated in Africa and Asia. In fact, *Z. Palustris* remains [undomesticated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication) to this day. The two species diverged twenty-six to thirty million years ago, with *Zizania* becoming established in North America about five million years ago and expanding across the continent using ice-age [refugia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacial_refugium).[^2] Wild rice stalks are known as manoomin, or "good berry," in Anishinaabe language and as Psíŋ in Dakota. 

*Zizania palustris*, whose specific epithet translate as "marshy" or "swampy" and refers to the aquatic habitat in which the plant grows, was published by [Carl Linnaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus) in his *Species Plantarum* (1753) and *Mantissa Plantarum Altera* (1771).[^3] Prior to that, *Z. Palustris* was thought to belong to *Z. Aquatica*, a species of wild rice native to the Eastern United States. With distinct but overlapping ranges and differences in size and shape, Linnaeus established the two as separate species. However, many refer to *Z. palustris* as *Z. aquatica* today.[^4] 

The turn of the twenty-first century saw the release of the first wild rice genome map, and with it, concerns over the flow of genes from cultivated to wild rice stands, or groups of plants.[^5] In the wild rice waters of northern Minnesota, researchers have found that wild rice populations are genetically distinct from one another, and that there is in fact very little [gene flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_flow) across watersheds.[^6] Concerns remain that genetically diverse wild stands, whose seeds are unable to be stored in [ex situ repositories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_bank), will be overtaken by genetically modified wild rice supergroups.[^7]

### Wild Rice in Indigenous Prophecy

In North America, the intertwined story of people and plant begins around 950 C.E. The Anishinaabe nation received a prophecy from the prophets of the [Seven Fires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_fires_prophecy) and a floating seashell, called the sacred [miigis](http://nativeamericannetroots.net/diary/1392). The prophecy instructed them to travel westwards to where the "food grows on water," referring to wild rice.[^8] The Anishinaabe migration occurred over the course of approximately five hundred years and included several legs to the journey. The Ojibwe people of the Anishinaabe nation eventually settled in Gichigami, the area east of Lake Superior, in present-day Minnesota. The movement of the Ojibwe pushed the [Dakota](https://www.mnhs.org/fortsnelling/learn/native-americans/dakota-people), the previous inhabitants of the region, to relocate to the south and west.

A special gift from the Creator that tied Anishinaabe people to lands, manoomin, as a part of Anishinaabe [materia medica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materia_medica), serves both ritual and medicinal purposes. Considered the most sacred *mashkiki*, or medicine, manoomin contains not only a material presence, but also spiritual one, providing both nourishment and healing.[^9] Used to promote recovery from sickness through ingestion or through topical poultices, manoomin harvest became a ritualized practice. The gathering of manoomin, and other *mashkiki*, from the Gichimanidoogitigan, or "Creator’s Garden," was timed in accordance with the autumnal harvest and was often overseen by a rice chief. Many of the key ceremonies in the Anishinaable ceremonial complex were timed in accordance with the harvest.[^10] The continued use of manoomin helps fulfill the prophecy that originally brought the Anishinaabe to the Great Lakes region. 

### Traders, Treaties, and Usufructuary Rights

Europeans first arrived in the Great Lakes region in the early seventeenth century, beginning with the French explorers and missionaries in the 1620s. The Ojibwe acted as guides, interpreters, and trading partners with the French, often using the Ojibwe language as the lingua franca in trading. Jacques Marquette, a French Jesuit missionary who was the first European to map the northern part of the Mississippi River Valley, described the "wild oat" as a "sort of grass," which resembled the wild oats growing amidst wheat in France. The French were struck by the plant’s likeness, in their eyes, to the leguminous tare grass, and referred to wild rice as *folle avoine*, translated as "wild oats" or "fool oats."[^11] Many compared the aquatic growing conditions of wild rice along lake and stream margins to the flooded [paddies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddy_field) used for rice cultivation in Asia. 

By the 1770s, a large-scale [fur trade](https://www.mnhs.org/fortsnelling/learn/fur-trade) had begun in the Great Lakes region, which lasted until the 1830s. Members of the Ojibwe acted as trading partners, guides, and interpreters for the French. Other Indigenous nations, including the Sioux, Algonquin, and Menominee, had harvested wild rice prior to Ojibwe trade with Europeans. The [Menominee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menominee) tribe specifically were referred to as *manoominiig*, or the "wild rice people" by both Ojibwe and French.[^12] As scholar Thomas Vennum wrote, "Each of these groups had a diversified economy and therefore depended upon wild rice for food and trade to differing degrees."[^13] In other cases, wild rice provided a means to keep the Anishinaabeg out of trade dependencies with entities such as the Hudson’s Bay Company by providing a surplus trade good.[^14]

Several land treaties between the Ojibwe and the United States were signed in the mid-nineteenth century, including the Treaty of 1836, Treaty of 1837, and the Treaty of 1842. The [Dawes Act of 1887](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawes_Act) forcibly removed Ojibwe from their land to boarding schools, camps, and mills. It also implemented the process of privatized land allotment, and led to the creation of reservations.[^15] The land treaties gave the Ojibwe usufructuary rights, or the "right to use legal property," which included the right to hunt, fish, and gather on ceded territory. Mere decades after the treaties were signed, the United States Army Corps of Engineers built a series of dams, intended to control and maintain a predictable water flow for downstream mills, in the upper Mississippi watershed. The destruction of wild rice habitat due to the flooding resulting from dam construction was compounded by the region’s timber logging industry. The colonial violence of assimilation and reallocation, along with forced removal and land cession, directly led to the breakdown of Ojibwe knowledge and kinship systems.[^16]

### Cultivation for Consumption

Both Americans and Europeans fostered ambitions to cultivate wild rice outside of its native habitat. Pehr Kalm, a well-known disciple of the Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus, undertook a collections tour of North America between 1747-1751. Under the instruction of Linnaeus—as part of a project to build a larger mercantile empire within Europe, and commissioned by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences—Kalm’s task was to collect a "kind of Rice… used by one Nation… as food instead of grains, which grows without cultivation there in all marshes and lakes."[^17] Kalm returned to Sweden with over one hundred plant species, including Zizania aquatica, or eastern wild rice, with the intention of domesticating the plant species in Scandinavia and trading it as a crop used for livestock feed and human consumption within greater Europe.[^18]

Many travelers to the Great Lakes region in the century following Kalm’s expedition viewed wild rice as productive crop well-suited for potential cultivation in the analogous climates of Northern Europe. Jonathan Carver, a colonel and explorer from Massachusetts, entertained the idea of producing wild rice as a domesticated crop in the "infant colonies" of the United States after traveling to the the western Great Lakes region in the late 1760s.[^19]

Carver and Kalm were not alone in entertaining the idea of cultivating wild rice. In his 1803 "Observation on the Zizania aquatica," botanist Aylmer Bourke Lambert described the transportation of Z. Aquatica seeds, from Canada to Europe, in glass jars. Long considered a "desideratum among the botanists of [/England]/," he noted his desire to grow the seeds in the "many shallow pieces of water" in Great Britain and Ireland. Beginning with French botanist André Michaux, few, if any, were able to grow wild rice in Europe. To many botanists, wild rice was poised to become Europe’s next commodified crop.
