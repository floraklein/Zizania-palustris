### Introduction

Known for its distinct flavor and chewy texture, wild rice has become a recognizable gourmet delicacy and health food staple. Today, many Americans encounter the plant in grocery stores sold by companies such as Benâ€™s Original. Wild rice, or *Zizania palustris*, is an aquatic grass species native to the Great Lakes region of North America. Evidence of human use dates to the Late Archaic and [Early Woodland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodland_period) periods, around two thousand years ago. The Ojibwe are one of three tribes constituting the Anishinaabe, or "original people," an Indigenous nation in the Great Lakes region of North America. For the Ojibwe, wild rice is not only a foodstuff and a medicinal plant whose use dates back thousands of years; it is also considered a sacred being with cultural and spiritual significance. Dependent on highly specific landscape conditions for growth, the history of wild rice draws upon botanical and Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and reflects a close interweaving between people, place, and plant.
