### Introduction

Known for its distinct flavor and chewy texture, [wild rice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_rice) has become a recognizable gourmet delicacy and health food staple. Today, many Americans encounter the plant in grocery stores sold by companies such as Ben’s Original. Wild rice, or *Zizania palustris*, is an aquatic grass species native to the Great Lakes region of North America. Evidence of human use dates to the Late Archaic and [Early Woodland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodland_period) periods, around two thousand years ago.[^1] The Ojibwe are one of three tribes constituting the [Anishinaabe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anishinaabe), or "original people," an Indigenous nation in the Great Lakes region of North America. For the Ojibwe, wild rice is not only a foodstuff and a medicinal plant whose use dates back thousands of years; it is also considered a sacred being with cultural and spiritual significance. Dependent on highly specific landscape conditions for growth, the history of wild rice draws upon botanical and [Traditional Ecological Knowledge](https://blog.ucs.org/science-blogger/the-importance-of-traditional-ecological-knowledge-tek-when-examining-climate-change/) (TEK) and reflects a close interweaving between people, place, and plant.

Since the 1950s, attempts at cultivating wild rice spread from Minnesota to California. Wild rice has transformed from a rare delicacy to a commonly found staple in the advent of commercialized production and institutionalized breeding programs. Indeed, the grain boasts many health benefits, including being low in fat and high in dietary fiber, minerals, protein, and vitamins. Demand for the highly nutritious monoecious crop has prompted tensions between Indigenous growers and large-scale commercialization and commodification of the plant. Despite being a food source for humans for thousands of years, the significance of wild rice has only recently become more widely studied and understood by a broader audience, including the scientific community and general public. Issues surrounding food sovereignty, climate change-induced habitat loss, and other environmental threats, have paved the way for groundbreaking legal developments, providing environmental protections based on the recognition of wild rice as a non-human person according to Indigenous worldviews.

### Botanical Nomenclature

Northern Wild Rice, or *Zizania palustris*, is one of four wild rice species native to North America. The *Zizania* genus is housed in the Oryzeae tribe of the Poaceae (grass) family and is comprised of four species, including *Z. palustris*, *Z. aquatica*, *Z. texana*, and *Z. latifolia*. *Z. palustris* is unrelated to the more commonly known Oryza white rice domesticated in Africa and Asia. In fact, *Z. Palustris* remains [undomesticated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication) to this day. The two species diverged twenty-six to thirty million years ago, with *Zizania* becoming established in North America about five million years ago and expanding across the continent using ice-age [refugia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacial_refugium).[^2] Wild rice stalks are known as manoomin, or "good berry," in Anishinaabe language and as Psíŋ in Dakota. 

*Zizania palustris*, whose specific epithet translate as "marshy" or "swampy" and refers to the aquatic habitat in which the plant grows, was published by [Carl Linnaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus) in his *Species Plantarum* (1753) and *Mantissa Plantarum Altera* (1771).[^3] Prior to that, *Z. Palustris* was thought to belong to *Z. Aquatica*, a species of wild rice native to the Eastern United States. With distinct but overlapping ranges and differences in size and shape, Linnaeus established the two as separate species. However, many refer to *Z. palustris* as *Z. aquatica* today.[^4] 

The turn of the twenty-first century saw the release of the first wild rice genome map, and with it, concerns over the flow of genes from cultivated to wild rice stands, or groups of plants.[^5] In the wild rice waters of northern Minnesota, researchers have found that wild rice populations are genetically distinct from one another, and that there is in fact very little [gene flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_flow) across watersheds.[^6] Concerns remain that genetically diverse wild stands, whose seeds are unable to be stored in [ex situ repositories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_bank), will be overtaken by genetically modified wild rice supergroups.[^7]

### Wild Rice in Indigenous Prophecy

In North America, the intertwined story of people and plant begins around 950 C.E. The Anishinaabe nation received a prophecy from the prophets of the [Seven Fires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_fires_prophecy) and a floating seashell, called the sacred [miigis](http://nativeamericannetroots.net/diary/1392). The prophecy instructed them to travel westwards to where the "food grows on water," referring to wild rice.[^8] The Anishinaabe migration occurred over the course of approximately five hundred years and included several legs to the journey. The Ojibwe people of the Anishinaabe nation eventually settled in Gichigami, the area east of Lake Superior, in present-day Minnesota. The movement of the Ojibwe pushed the [Dakota](https://www.mnhs.org/fortsnelling/learn/native-americans/dakota-people), the previous inhabitants of the region, to relocate to the south and west.

A special gift from the Creator that tied Anishinaabe people to lands, manoomin, as a part of Anishinaabe [materia medica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materia_medica), serves both ritual and medicinal purposes. Considered the most sacred *mashkiki*, or medicine, manoomin contains not only a material presence, but also spiritual one, providing both nourishment and healing.[^9] Used to promote recovery from sickness through ingestion or through topical poultices, manoomin harvest became a ritualized practice. The gathering of manoomin, and other *mashkiki*, from the Gichimanidoogitigan, or "Creator’s Garden," was timed in accordance with the autumnal harvest and was often overseen by a rice chief. Many of the key ceremonies in the Anishinaable ceremonial complex were timed in accordance with the harvest.[^10] The continued use of manoomin helps fulfill the prophecy that originally brought the Anishinaabe to the Great Lakes region. 

### Traders, Treaties, and Usufructuary Rights

Europeans first arrived in the Great Lakes region in the early seventeenth century, beginning with the French explorers and missionaries in the 1620s. The Ojibwe acted as guides, interpreters, and trading partners with the French, often using the Ojibwe language as the lingua franca in trading. Jacques Marquette, a French Jesuit missionary who was the first European to map the northern part of the Mississippi River Valley, described the "wild oat" as a "sort of grass," which resembled the wild oats growing amidst wheat in France. The French were struck by the plant’s likeness, in their eyes, to the leguminous tare grass, and referred to wild rice as *folle avoine*, translated as "wild oats" or "fool oats."[^11] Many compared the aquatic growing conditions of wild rice along lake and stream margins to the flooded [paddies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddy_field) used for rice cultivation in Asia. 

By the 1770s, a large-scale [fur trade](https://www.mnhs.org/fortsnelling/learn/fur-trade) had begun in the Great Lakes region, which lasted until the 1830s. Members of the Ojibwe acted as trading partners, guides, and interpreters for the French. Other Indigenous nations, including the Sioux, Algonquin, and Menominee, had harvested wild rice prior to Ojibwe trade with Europeans. The [Menominee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menominee) tribe specifically were referred to as *manoominiig*, or the "wild rice people" by both Ojibwe and French.[^12] As scholar Thomas Vennum wrote, "Each of these groups had a diversified economy and therefore depended upon wild rice for food and trade to differing degrees."[^13] In other cases, wild rice provided a means to keep the Anishinaabeg out of trade dependencies with entities such as the Hudson’s Bay Company by providing a surplus trade good.[^14]

Several land treaties between the Ojibwe and the United States were signed in the mid-nineteenth century, including the Treaty of 1836, Treaty of 1837, and the Treaty of 1842. The [Dawes Act of 1887](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawes_Act) forcibly removed Ojibwe from their land to boarding schools, camps, and mills. It also implemented the process of privatized land allotment, and led to the creation of reservations.[^15] The land treaties gave the Ojibwe usufructuary rights, or the "right to use legal property," which included the right to hunt, fish, and gather on ceded territory. Mere decades after the treaties were signed, the United States Army Corps of Engineers built a series of dams, intended to control and maintain a predictable water flow for downstream mills, in the upper Mississippi watershed. The destruction of wild rice habitat due to the flooding resulting from dam construction was compounded by the region’s timber logging industry. The colonial violence of assimilation and reallocation, along with forced removal and land cession, directly led to the breakdown of Ojibwe knowledge and kinship systems.[^16]

### Cultivation for Consumption

Both Americans and Europeans fostered ambitions to cultivate wild rice outside of its native habitat. Pehr Kalm, a well-known disciple of the Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus, undertook a collections tour of North America between 1747-1751. Under the instruction of Linnaeus—as part of a project to build a larger mercantile empire within Europe, and commissioned by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences—Kalm’s task was to collect a "kind of Rice… used by one Nation… as food instead of grains, which grows without cultivation there in all marshes and lakes."[^17] Kalm returned to Sweden with over one hundred plant species, including Zizania aquatica, or eastern wild rice, with the intention of domesticating the plant species in Scandinavia and trading it as a crop used for livestock feed and human consumption within greater Europe.[^18]

Many travelers to the Great Lakes region in the century following Kalm’s expedition viewed wild rice as productive crop well-suited for potential cultivation in the analogous climates of Northern Europe. Jonathan Carver, a colonel and explorer from Massachusetts, entertained the idea of producing wild rice as a domesticated crop in the "infant colonies" of the United States after traveling to the the western Great Lakes region in the late 1760s.[^19]

Carver and Kalm were not alone in entertaining the idea of cultivating wild rice. In his 1803 "Observation on the Zizania aquatica," botanist Aylmer Bourke Lambert described the transportation of Z. Aquatica seeds, from Canada to Europe, in glass jars. Long considered a "desideratum among the botanists of \[England\]," he noted his desire to grow the seeds in the "many shallow pieces of water" in Great Britain and Ireland.[^20] Beginning with French botanist André Michaux, few, if any, were able to grow wild rice in Europe.[^21] To many botanists, wild rice was poised to become Europe’s next commodified crop.

However, botanists were beginning to understand that seeds alone were not enough to ensure that the plant would flourish in Europe. Indeed, the highly specific habitat conditions required for wild rice growth meant that these early cultivation attempts failed. In an 1852 United States geological survey, American geologist David Dale Owen wrote: "This grain has been frequently introduced to the attention of cultivators, and is worth of notice, not only for the value of its products, but the peculiar nature of the soil to which it is adapted, being necessarily unfit for any of our ordinary cultivated grains." He later specified, "It is in these situations best exposed to the proper degree of inundation, and finds a suitable bed of the slimy sand, in which \[wild rice\] grows most readily. It is rarely met with on inland lakes which have no outlet."[^22] Owen described the specific features of wild rice habitat, including the regular inundation, steady water flow, and relative water depth required for wild rice growth in aquatic habitats, painting a picture of the unique landscapes that proved critical to the plant’s successful growth. 

### Harvest Histories

In "Gathering Wild Rice, 1849-1855," artist Seth Eastman depicts three women, most likely Anishinaabe, who are in the process of harvesting wild rice. This watercolor drawing, the first known painting of wild rice, depicts one woman paddling a canoe and two others beating rice stalks with flat paddles. American anthropologist and ethnographer Frances Densmore later captured the multi-step harvesting process in her photography from the early twentieth century. In her 1928 "How Indians Use Wild Plants for Food, Medicine, and Crafts," Densmore describes the process of establishing harvesting camps and the act of "ricing" itself, in which Ojibwe women would harvest using birchbark canoes.[^23] When ricing, one person would paddle the canoe using a push pole (Gaandakii-iganaak), while another would knock rice stalks with special sticks (Bawa’iganaak) so that ripe rice seeds would fall into the canoe and into the lake water. After harvesting, the rice was dried on birchbark sheets, parched to loosen the husk, and pounded with wooden pastels. It would then be winnowed and trodden upon, and later stored. Year after year over the course of centuries the knowledge and practices of ricing would be passed down through generations of Ojibwe. 

Cultural traditions involving wild rice were closely linked to the seasons. Many key traditional Anishinaabe ceremonies and rituals were timed in accordance with the thanksgiving for manoomin harvest.[^24] Anishinaabe harvesters would set up harvest camps, or Manoominikewin, for "ricing." In 1820, Henry Schoolcraft, on an expedition to find the source of the Mississippi River, noted the role of wild rice as a foodstuff closely linked to seasonal change: "The necessity of changing their camps often, to procure game or fish, the want of domesticated animals, the general dependence on wild rice, and the custom of journeying in canoes, has produced a general uniformity of life."[^25]

Historically, both Ojibwe men and women performed wild rice harvesting, with men steering the canoe and women knocking the grains into the canoe. In the decades following land cessions, forced migration, and colonial settlement, the labor relations and gender roles involved in harvesting changed. During the early twentieth century, the state of Minnesota created [wild rice camps](https://www.kaxe.org/local-news/2023-09-22/wild-rice-camp-highlights-sacred-plant-and-the-fight-to-protect-it), and state control over wild rice harvesting was codified in 1939.[^26] Ojibwe women were active in the organization and labor of wild rice economies throughout this tumultuous period. According to Ojibwe historian Brenda Child, the wild rice waters and ricing camps were gendered spaces that clearly expressed women’s autonomy. The wild rice waters themselves became a gendered landscape through women’s involvement in and jurisdiction over harvesting and ricing.[^27]

### Landscape as Collaborator

Wild rice plays an important part in the aquatic plant communities of the northern Great Lakes region. It benefits local food networks and wetland ecology by participating in the [water nutrient cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient_cycle), stabilizing coastal river wetland sediment, and providing habitat for other species. Rooted in sediment, the plant grows along the margins of small streams and shallow lakes. Albert Jenks, a University of Minnesota professor of anthropology, noted the specific landscape conditions required for its growth in his *Wild Rice Gatherers of the Upper Lakes* (1907): "Wherever the last glacier left little mid-bottomed, water-filled hollows, there wild rice has established itself, if other conditions are favorable. Such ponds and lakes are characteristic of the alluvial apron spread out over Wisconsin and Minnesota."[^28]

Like other grasses, a crucial phase of the wild rice’s life cycle is the shattering of the mature seed, which is when the seed drops off the plant once it ripens. Seed heads are located at the top of the plant and ripe seeds drop from the plant into the water, sinking to the soil where they remain dormant over the winter. They usually [germinate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germination) in the following spring. By early summer, wild rice forms floating mats of leaves and seeds cross-pollinated by wind. After reaching maturity in late summer and harvested in late summer or early autumn, the grass dies. Seed shattering occurs over days to weeks, which allows for multiple harvests to take place. 

Harvesting was not only a process of gathering but also a process of reseeding the plant for future harvests. Jenks wrote that "the plant, unless it is artificially sown, is gradually being extinguished in such beds as are continuously used."[^29] The significant portion of seeds being knocked back into water rather than harvested in the canoe was not waste, but an active management strategy. Responsive to changing environmental conditions, the reseeding during harvest treats the landscape as a collaborator: wild rice seeds require submergence in the soil during undisturbed dormancy in order to remain viable. The aquatic landscape remains an active participant in the reseeding process, which highlights the importance of the landscape itself in maintaining a relationship between wild rice and humans. The artificial sowing of wild rice seeds is one example of the activation of Traditional Ecological Knowledge.[^30]

### Cultivation, Commodification, and Commercialization

Cultivation was spearheaded in the 1950s by university scientist Ervin Oelke, who had collected germ plasms from twenty-four natural stands, or a community of organisms growing in a specific location, that fell within the 1837 treaty area.[^31] An official wild rice breeding program was established at the University of Minnesota in the 1960s. The aim of the program was to cultivate wild rice with disease and pest resistance and to produce non-seed shattering varieties. This would facilitate mechanical harvest and increase yield size. The program ultimately produced four strands of cultivated "wild" rice between 1968 and 2000. By 1969, the Minnesota state legislature provided funding for *Z. palustris* cultivation and by 2017, appropriated recurring funding for the Northern Wild Rice breeding and genetics program.

In the early 1960s, food product company Uncle Ben’s Inc.—now called Ben’s Original and owned by Mars, Inc.—began incorporating wild rice into its rice blend. Cultivated wild rice production in northern California’s Sacramento Valley began in the 1970s.[^32] In the 1980s, both Uncle Ben’s Inc. and NorCal, another California cultivator, established patents for their cultivated hybrid wild rice varieties. Between 1983 and 1986, wild rice production had surpassed Minnesota, and by 2020 California produced 95% of all cultivated wild rice. Wild rice was also commercially cultivated in Canada, where, by 2023, the crop’s revenue surpassed $5 million CAN.[^33]

Cultivation is domestication occurring in real time. Today, cultivated wild rice is grown in California, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, and is exported worldwide. Wild rice has been introduced to Turkey, and the United Kingdom is the largest export market for United States-grown cultivated wild rice.[^34] Indigenous growers mainly sell directly to domestic consumers while commercially cultivated wild rice is sold to large retailers. Increased consumer access to wild rice through commercialization, often at a lower cost to consumers, has also transformed the plant’s identity from a delicacy to an everyday staple as more people are able to access and incorporate wild rice into their diet.

### Recognizing the Rights of Nature

With rising temperatures and less ice cover, the proliferation of wild rice is severely threatened by climate change. Its seeds, which require frozen temperatures during their dormancy, are not able to germinate as well or at all. In addition, rapid fluctuations in water depth due to severe weather events, like concentrated rainfall events and droughts, disrupt plant growth, and as a result, the amount of suitable habitat shrinks.

Serious threats are posed to naturally occurring wild rice stands by the potential expansion of copper and nickel open-pit mining, and their toxic discharges. The amount of sulfate in the St. Louis watershed has increased over the past half century. Today, pipelines like the Enbridge "Line 3" and others threaten the health not only of wild rice habitats, but also of the entire St. Louis watershed and the ecosystems contained therein. 

On New Year’s Eve 2018, the White Earth Nation of [Ojibwe](https://pluralism.org/anishinaabe-ojibwe-ways) formally recognized the legal rights of manoomin, also known as wild rice (*Zizania palustris*). This declaration in tribal law included manoomin’s right to exist, flourish, regenerate, and evolve.[^35] The recognition of wild rice legal rights in tribal court is one of many cases in a global movement aimed at recognizing the legal rights of species and ecosystems. It is believed to be the first case in the United States brought before a tribal court on behalf of the [rights of nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights_of_nature) and attempts to establish legal rights for species and ecosystems. The case reflects an assertion of the close relationship between plant, people, and landscape predicated on an understanding of kinship and mutual reliance according to Indigenous worldview.[^36]

On August 4, 2021, the White Earth Band of Ojibwe and manoomin filed a lawsuit against the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR).[^37] *Manoomin v. Minnesota Department of Natural Resources* was the first rights of nature case to be brought before a tribal court. The action argued that the DNR had violated treaty rights by putting manoomin at risk by issuing an amended permit to the Enbridge corporation, who had temporarily pumped five billion gallons of water out of wild rice habitat, and asked for the DNR to nullify the pipeline water permits.
